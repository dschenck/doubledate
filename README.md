# doubledate
Managing irregular calendars isn't hard per-se, but it can be painful, especially in the context of trading calendars and backtesting. That is why doubledate exposes a nifty `Calendar` class to work with custom calendars.

## Installation
The best - and easiest - way to install `doubledate` is by calling:
```python
pip install doubledate 
```
